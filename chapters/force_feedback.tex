The following sections will outline the design steps taken to determine the force feedback characteristics.

\section{Force literature and Testing} % (fold)
\label{sec:force_literature_and_testing}

During the first client meeting, it was decided that the haptic feedback should apply 20 noticeable force increments from the joystick's top-dead position to the boundary of its range of motion. Conducting a literature review on the characteristics of human touch, it was discovered that the finger can detect a force as small as \SI{0.06}{\newton}, and only notices force changes which are 7\% or greater.
These values were used to form the hypothesis for the preliminary haptic tests (See Progress report).
The results of these tests showed that on average, the minimum force the users could detect is \SI{0.11}{\newton}, with a minimum noticeable increment of 10\%.
Additionally, two qualitative tests were conducted to find the maximum force a user could comfortably resist, and the ideal range of motion for various joystick lengths. The results showed that on average, the maximum force is \SI{1.19}{\newton} and the range of motion is \SI{90}{\degree} (\SIrange{-45}{45}{\degree}).

[Insert schematic here]

However, a range of 40 steps over \SI{90}{\degree} meant each increment would be \SI{2.25}{\degree}, and given encoder choice (see section X) with a precision of \SI{0.1}{\degree} this level of precision could not be achieved. It was therefore decided to increase this range to \SI{100}{\degree}, resulting in \SI{2.5}{\degree} steps which the encoders can accurately measure.

\section{Step Design} % (fold)
\label{sec:step_design}

Using the maximum force range and increments specified in section X, namely 20 steps over \SIrange{0.11}{1.19}{\newton}, the actual relationship between force and joystick position could be established.

\begin{figure}
  \input{plots/linear_force_location}
  \caption{Linear force location relationship}
  \label{fig:linear_force_location}
\end{figure}

For a linear relationship, the force applied on the surgeon's finger would increase by \SI{0.054}{\newton} every \SI{2.5}{\degree} over the \SIrange{0.11}{1.19}{\newton} range, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:linear_force_location}.

\begin{figure}
  \input{plots/percentage_increment_linear}
  \caption{Percentage increment per step for linear relationship}
  \label{fig:percentage_increment_linear}
\end{figure}

However, from the surgeon's point of view, it feels like each step is getting smaller, as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:percentage_increment_linear}.
This shows that initially the surgeon detects large increments, but each individual force step after \SI{20}{\degree} will not be noticeable.
Thus, a logarithmic relationship between the force and the location was designed.

Solving equation~\ref{eq:logarithmic_increments} for the force values given,
\\
\begin{equation}
  F_{\text{min}} \times i^{20} = F_{\text{max}}
  \label{eq:logarithmic_increments}
\end{equation}

the increment ($i$) is 1.126, i.e. a 12.6\% increase for every \SI{2.5}{\degree}.
This is 2.6\% higher than the minimum found during testing.

The final force-position relationship is shown in equation~\ref{eq:final_force_pos}, and represented graphically in Figure~\ref{fig:logarithmic_force_location}.
\\
\begin{equation}
  F = 0.11 \times 1.126^{\frac{\theta}{2.5}}
  \label{eq:final_force_pos}
\end{equation}

Where $\theta$ is the angular position of the joystick.

\section{Limitations based on electronic system} % (fold)
\label{sec:limitations_based_on_electronic_system}

The forces and steps determined above are for an ideal system and are treated as a guide for choosing values for the real world application.

The RoboClaw motor controller, used to drive the motors, splits the voltage range (\SIrange{0}{24}{\volt}) into 128 steps (7 bit), resulting in a resolution of \SI{0.189}{\volt}.
Given the motor characterisation outlined in section X, it was found that the system has a current threshold of \SI{0.8}{\ampere} when the first logic level (\SI{0.189}{\volt}) was applied, as was shown in Figure~\ref{fig:motor_1}.

This means that, given the actual torque constant of $K_t$ determined in the motor characterisation in section~\ref{sec:motors}, the minimum torque applied by the motors is $0.8 K_t$. Thus, the minimum force on the surgeon's finger given the joystick length of \SI{11}{\centi\metre} is \SI{0.26}{\newton}.
Additionally, the current resolution (using the voltage resolution) is \SI{0.03}{\ampere}, which is 3.75\% of the \SI{0.8}{\ampere} minimum current, meaning increments of 10\% can be achieved.

To achieve the tested maximum force of \SI{1.19}{\newton}, the motors would need to apply \SI{143}{\milli\newton\metre} of torque. The following two sections will consider the thermal and stress analysis of our system to determine whether this torque can be applied.

\section{Thermal Analysis} % (fold)
\label{sec:thermal_analysis}

To start with, the thermal characteristics of the motors were modelled at steady state for each current level, using the following assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Current is held constant long enough until the system is at thermal steady state
  \item Ambient temperature inside the casing is held constant at \SI{20}{\celsius}
  \item Thermal resistances given in the datasheet are correct
  \item At stall current, 80\% of the power flowing to the motors is converted into heat
\end{itemize}

The motors can be represented using the thermal circuit shown in Figure~\ref{fig:motor_thermals}.
To find the power flowing through the circuit at each current interval, the equation
\\
\begin{equation}
  P = I^2 R
\end{equation}

is used.
When the windings are at \SI{125}{\celsius}, their resistance is obtained using the temperature dependence equation,
\\
\begin{equation}
  R_{T=\SI{125}{\celsius}} = R_{T=\SI{20}{\celsius}} (1 + \alpha (\Delta T))
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ is the temperature coefficient of resistance for copper (\SI{0.0004}{\per\kelvin}), giving $R_{T=\SI{125}{\celsius}} = \SI{8.1}{\ohm}$.

The temperature difference between the windings and ambient is then determined by equation~\ref{eq:temp_difference}, the temperature distribution is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:temp_windings}.
\\
\begin{equation}
  T_{difference} = Q R_{thermal} = 0.8 \times I^2 R_{electrical} \times R_{thermal}
  \label{eq:temp_difference}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
  \input{plots/temp_windings}
  \caption{Steady state $T_{windings}$ for $T_{casing} = \SI{20}{\degree}$ based on current}
  \label{fig:temp_windings}
\end{figure}

The maximum temperature which the windings can sustain is \SI{125}{\degree}, meaning only torques up to \SI{45.5}{\milli\newton\metre} can be applied continuously, as outlined in the datasheet.
As this would only give us a small range of \SIrange{28.8}{45}{\milli\newton\metre}, we needed to determine how long each torque step over \SI{45.5}{\milli\newton\metre} could be applied before the windings reach \SI{125}{\degree}.

To do this, the worst case scenario was analysed based on the following assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item All power ($I^2R_{electrical}$) is used to increase the temperature of the windings
  \item The temperature of the windings rises at a constant rate
  \item The resistance ($R_{electrical}$) is taken as the mean resistance, i.e. $R_{electrical,\SI{75}{\celsius}}$
  \item Mass of the windings is \SI{50}{\gram}
\end{itemize}

Then, the time taken was calculated using equation~\ref{eq:heating_time}, giving the distribution shown in Figure~\ref{fig:overheating_times}.
\\
\begin{equation}
  t = \frac{m c_p \Delta T}{I^2 R_{electrical, \SI{72.5}{\celsius}}}
  \label{eq:heating_time}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
  \input{plots/overheating_times}
  \caption{Time torque can be applied before $T_{windings} = \SI{125}{\celsius}$}
  \label{fig:overheating_times}
\end{figure}

Where $c_p$ is the heat capacity of copper.

Using the times obtained above, we find that the motors can be at maximum torque for 20 seconds before the windings reach their maximum temperature, a very unlikely situation given their application. During use, the surgeon is expected to spend most of the time inside the "go-zone" where the motors are switched off.
Therefore, it is fine to use the motors up to our desired maximum torque of \SI{143}{\milli\newton\metre}.
